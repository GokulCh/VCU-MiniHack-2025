# Eco Health Quest

Eco Health Quest is a web-based platform designed to encourage fitness while promoting environmental sustainability. The goal is to reward users for staying active and completing eco-friendly challenges, like picking up litter, to make a positive impact on the planet.

## Inspiration

The inspiration behind Eco Health Quest came from the idea of turning everyday fitness activities into a force for environmental change. Seeing plastic waste while out on a walk or run made us think: what if staying active could also help clean the planet?

## What it Does

Eco Health Quest is an app concept that encourages users to stay active while helping the environment. Users can track their movement, complete eco-challenges like picking up litter, and earn rewards for making a positive impact.

## How We Built It

In just five hours, we focused on efficiently dividing tasks and creating a visually appealing skeleton website that represents our mission. Our goal was to design pages that clearly showcase the idea behind Eco Health Quest and lay the groundwork for future development.

## Challenges We Ran Into

With limited time, our main challenge was organizing tasks effectively and ensuring the website visually communicated our mission. We aimed to create an engaging and intuitive user experience despite having only a basic framework.

## Accomplishments That We're Proud Of

We’re proud of how quickly we collaborated to bring the concept to life. Even with a short timeframe, we built a clean, professional-looking website that effectively represents the vision of Eco Health Quest.

## What We Learned

We learned the importance of rapid prototyping, effective teamwork, and designing with purpose. Even without a fully functional app, a well-structured and visually appealing presentation can effectively communicate an idea.

## What's Next for Eco Health Quest

The next steps involve adding functionality to the platform, including user activity tracking, challenges, and a reward system. We also plan to refine the design and improve user engagement features to make Eco Health Quest a fully interactive experience.
